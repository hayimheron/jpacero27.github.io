      <p>Climbers have dozens of mountains to choose from in Ecuador, but most head up the same peaks, especially the two highest -- Chimborazo and Cotopaxi -- which may be ascended by several groups at once during the driest months. Here are the biggest and most popular peaks:
        <br>
        <br>

<b> Chimborazo (6,310m/20,702 ft.)</b> This massive glacier-encrusted peak, 150km (93 miles) south of Quito, has five summits, the highest of which is named for Whymper, who believed it was the tallest mountain in the world when he ascended it in 1880. It has claimed the lives of many climbers and requires experience and acclimation. Best weather: June to January.
<br>
<br> <b>Cotopaxi (5,897m/19,347 ft.)</b> A perfectly conical, snowcapped volcano less than an hour south of Quito, Ecuador's second-highest mountain is also its most popular climb. Though technically straightforward, the ascent demands good physical conditioning, ice axes, crampons, and ropes. It can be climbed year-round, but the best weather is in December, January, and July to September.
